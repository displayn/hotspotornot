    {
      "label": "How does \"Hotspot or not?\" work?",
      "answer": "“Hotspot or not?” shows whether you are in a Covid-19 hotspot. You can either use your current location or enter a city. This location is then used to fetch stats of infections from the Robert Koch Institut (RKI). “Hotspot or not?” calculates whether this location is a Covid-19 hotspot."
    },
    {
      "label": "How does “Hotspot or not?” use my location?",
      "answer": "You have the option to share your location with “Hotspot or not?”. This location is then used to fetch the 7 days incidence of your area."
    },
    {
      "label": "Which of my personal data is stored?",
      "answer": "“Hotspot or not?” does not store any personal data and does not use any cookies."
    },
    {
      "label": "What is a Covid-19 hotspot?",
      "answer": "An area with an incidence value of over 35 is a Covid-19 hotspot. With an incidence value of over 50, it is seen as a critical hotspot."
    },
    {
      "label": "Are results on “Hotspot or not?” up to date?",
      "answer": "“Hotspot or not?” always uses the latest information from the RKI available for your location. Sometimes, the incidence reported by your area can be more up to date. Usually this is because they are reported to the RKI with some delay."
    },
    {
      "label": "Why can the incidence value on “Hotspot or not?” be different from the local health department?",
      "answer": "Sometimes, there is a slight delay when reporting numbers from the local health department to the RKI."
    },
    {
      "label": "What does incidence value mean?",
      "answer": "The incidence value shows how many people per 100.000 were infected with Covid-19."
    },
    {
      "label": "I have a problem. Where can I contact you?",
      "answer": "In case you have any problems, feedback or questions, feel free to contact us at <a href=\"mailto:service@hotspotornot.de\">service@hotspotornot.de</a>."
